# UFO Sighting
## Overview of Project
In this project, we created a table to organize UFO sighting data that is stored as a JavaScript dictionary. This table is available as a webpage and gives the user the option to filter data based on certain criteria. The coding was done using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

## Results
User can access UFO sighting data by filtering the database based on the following criteria:
* Date of observation
* City in which UFO observed 
* State in which UFO observed
* Country in which UFO observed
* Shape of UFO
User can enter all the desired criteria listed above or only a subset of those. For example, the following shows the table of UFO sighting only for sightings reported in state of California.

A screenshot of search table using all input criteria is shown below:

## Summary
The designed website efficiently provides the UFO sighting data based on a search criterion selected by user.
### Drawback 
* One drawback of this website is that the UFO sighting data lacks authentication. It will be useful to have data of how many people have independently reported the UFO.
* Another drawback is the volume of the data can be large and it is hard for a user to screen through the large table
### Recommendations
* it will be useful if the user can get some statistical analysis of UFO sighting events. For example, what is the average sighting period? which areas in the world have the most sighting and which areas have the least number of sightings?
* it will be helpful to provide an interactive map showing locations of the UFO sighting
